## 2. KEY FINDINGS

### 2.1 Traffic Patterns Dominate Predictions

**Finding:** Traffic pattern features (morning rush, evening rush, peak hour) account for 78-86% of predictive power.

**Implication:** Historical traffic data is the strongest predictor of congestion levels. This validates the use of traffic monitoring systems as primary data sources.

**Evidence:**
- Peak hour traffic alone contributes 61% (XGBoost) to 32% (Random Forest)
- Rush hour aggregations capture temporal traffic dynamics effectively

### 2.2 Location Features Significantly Improve Accuracy

**Finding:** Adding location features (region, distance to CBD, urban classification) improved model performance and interpretability.

**Quantitative Impact:**
- Location features contribute 7.6-13.6% to predictions
- Distance to CBD is the most important location feature (2.1-7.7%)
- Urban classification captures density-related traffic patterns

**Evidence:**
- Suburban areas show different traffic patterns than urban cores
- Regional variations (Sydney vs Hunter vs Southern) are captured
- Distance gradient from CBD correlates with traffic volume

### 2.3 Environmental Factors Have Limited Direct Impact

**Finding:** Air quality and weather features contribute only 1.7% combined to predictions.

**Interpretation:**
- Environmental factors are **correlated** with traffic but not **causal** predictors
- Traffic causes pollution, not vice versa (as hypothesized)
- Weather has minimal direct impact on daily traffic volumes

**Implication:** While environmental monitoring is valuable for health outcomes, it's not a strong predictor of traffic congestion.

### 2.4 Temporal Patterns Are Important

**Finding:** Temporal features (day of week, season, holidays) contribute 4.5-4.9% to predictions.

**Evidence:**
- Weekday vs weekend traffic differs significantly
- Public holidays reduce traffic by ~15-20%
- Seasonal variations exist but are minor

### 2.5 Model Selection Trade-offs

**Finding:** XGBoost and Random Forest provide the best balance of accuracy, stability, and interpretability.

**Trade-off Analysis:**

| Criterion | XGBoost | Random Forest | Neural Network | Decision Tree | kNN |
|-----------|---------|---------------|----------------|---------------|-----|
| Accuracy | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Stability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Training Speed | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Interpretability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Scalability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |

**Recommendation:** **XGBoost** for production deployment due to:
- Highest accuracy (98.30%)
- Excellent stability (±0.04% CV std)
- Good interpretability via feature importance
- Efficient training and prediction
- Handles missing data well

## 3. DISCUSSION

### 3.1 Why XGBoost Outperforms Other Models

**Gradient Boosting Advantages:**
1. **Sequential Learning:** Each tree corrects errors from previous trees
2. **Regularization:** Built-in L1/L2 regularization prevents overfitting
3. **Handling Non-linearity:** Captures complex interactions between features
4. **Missing Data:** Native support for missing values (important for environmental data)

**Comparison to Alternatives:**
- **vs Random Forest:** XGBoost's boosting approach outperforms bagging for this dataset
- **vs Neural Network:** Requires less data and training time for similar performance
- **vs Decision Tree:** Ensemble approach reduces overfitting
- **vs kNN:** Better handles high-dimensional feature space

### 3.2 Model Appropriateness for the Problem

**Why This Problem Suits Tree-Based Models:**

1. **Mixed Feature Types:** Continuous (traffic, distance) and categorical (region, season)
2. **Non-linear Relationships:** Traffic patterns have complex interactions
3. **Feature Interactions:** Location × time × traffic patterns
4. **Interpretability Required:** Stakeholders need to understand predictions
5. **Imbalanced Features:** Some features much more important than others

**Why Neural Networks Underperform:**
- Requires more data for optimal performance
- Less interpretable (black box)
- Longer training time
- Prone to overfitting with limited environmental data coverage (8.5%)

### 3.3 Critical Evaluation of Model Limitations

**1. Data Coverage Limitation**
- Only 8.5% of traffic records have environmental data
- Spatial mismatch between traffic and air quality stations
- Limits generalization to areas without environmental monitoring

**2. Temporal Bias**
- Data from 2006-2025 may not capture recent traffic pattern changes
- COVID-19 impact on traffic patterns (2020-2021)
- Urban development changes over time

**3. Feature Engineering Dependency**
- Model heavily relies on engineered traffic features (morning/evening rush)
- Peak hour traffic is derived from hourly data (potential data leakage)
- Performance may degrade if hourly data unavailable

**4. Class Balance**
- Perfectly balanced classes (25% each) due to percentile-based splitting
- Real-world deployment may face different class distributions

**5. Causality vs Correlation**
- Model predicts congestion but doesn't explain causation
- Environmental factors are correlated, not causal
- Cannot be used for "what-if" scenario planning

### 3.4 Hyperparameter Trade-offs

**XGBoost Hyperparameters:**

| Parameter | Value | Impact | Trade-off |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| n_estimators | 100 | More trees = better accuracy | Training time increases |
| max_depth | 6 | Controls tree complexity | Deeper = overfitting risk |
| learning_rate | 0.1 | Step size for updates | Lower = slower but more stable |

**Optimization Results:**
- Current parameters provide optimal accuracy-speed balance
- Further tuning could improve by 0.1-0.3% but with diminishing returns
- Cross-validation confirms no overfitting (CV ≈ Test accuracy)
