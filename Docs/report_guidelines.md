## 3. Top Project Topics from 2025

* Heavy representation in **Healthcare**.
* Growing presence of **Transportation**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Sustainability**.

## 4. Project Proposal Requirements

Your proposal must include:

1. **Title & Abstract** – A short descriptive title and a one-paragraph summary.
2. **Justification** – Why the project matters, societal impacts, cost-benefit, novelty compared to existing methods.
3. **Objectives** – Clear goals, broken into sub-problems. Each sub-problem must contribute to solving the main issue.
4. **Proposed Method of Solution** – Implementation strategy, timeline, level of technical detail (without re-explaining basics).
5. **Ethical & Moral Issues** – Identify potential risks of adoption (bias, fairness, safety, privacy).
6. **Data** – Identify or plan to source multiple datasets. Avoid relying on a single simple CSV file.
7. **Team Structure** – Define roles, responsibilities, and contributions. Ensure equal work distribution between coding, writing, and analysis.

**Length:** Maximum 3 A4 pages (≈1000 words).
**Note:** If GenAI is used, include the original prompt in the appendix. Submissions must **modify GenAI output** before submission.

---

## 5. What Makes a Strong Project Proposal?

* **Tell a Story:** Present the problem, why it matters, and how you will solve it.
* **Be Structured:** Complication → Solution → Execution.
* **Think Beyond Mechanics:** Show influence and potential beyond just technical methods.

**Example Proposal (Education):**
Each year, countless students disengage and withdraw—not due to lack of ability, but because early warning signs are missed. This project proposes an AI-powered platform to detect disengagement patterns early, enabling targeted interventions by educators.

---

## 6. General Principles in Communication

* **Be precise and concise:** Avoid unnecessary fluff.
* **Be structured and logical:** Ensure smooth flow of ideas.
* **Be creative and engaging:** Use storytelling to spark interest.
* **Commit to refining:** Strong writing comes from revision.

---

## 7. Title Guidelines

A strong title should:

* Be catchy, focused, and self-explanatory.
* Be 6–12 words.

**Template:**
*Power Word / Catchy Phrase*: What it does / For whom / Why it matters

**Examples:**

1. Smart Bridges: Predictive Maintenance Powered by Machine Learning
2. Detecting Dementia Early: A Non-Invasive Diagnostic Approach
3. SmartMoves: Optimising Urban Transit with Data Insights
4. Safe Skies: Autonomous Obstacle Navigation for UAVs using AI

---

## 8. Abstract Guidelines

A one-paragraph summary:

* **Objectives** – What you aim to achieve.
* **Methods** – How you plan to achieve it.
* **Novelty** – Why it is different from existing solutions.
* **Dimensions** – Any broader aspects explored.
* **Deliverables** – Expected outputs.

---

## 9. Justifying Your Project

Address the following:

* Why is this project timely and important?
* Who benefits and how?
* What has been done before?
* What’s innovative about your approach?
* What risks might arise, and how will you handle them?

---

## 10. Method of Solution

* Break down the big problem into sub-problems.
* Suggest feasible solutions for each.
* Define performance metrics and comparison methods.
* Highlight novelty and prior work connections.

**Do Not:**

* Repeat basic lecture material (e.g., how to clean data, definitions of accuracy).

---

## 11. Ethical & Moral Considerations

AI is **narrow** (task-specific), not **general** (human-like intelligence). Even narrow AI can have unintended harmful effects.

**Key Issues:**

* **Safety:** Risk of false recognition in security systems.
* **Privacy:** Risk of surveillance overreach.
* **Fairness:** Risk of bias in financial/medical systems.
* **Legal Responsibility:** Liability in case of AI-driven harm.
* **Moral Complexity:** AI lacks human-like judgment.
* **Bias in Decision-Making:** Training data may perpetuate inequalities.
* **Need for Regulation:** Ensure accountability, transparency, and fairness.

## 12. Final Points

* Tell a story – with a natural start, middle, and end.
* Do your research – datasets, prior work, potential markets.
* Think in a “T” shape – both deep (technical methods) and broad (societal impact).
* Include non-technical aspects – societal, ethical, and practical considerations.
* Creativity is valued – ambition is encouraged even if everything isn’t achieved.
* Work as a team – clear responsibilities, regular check-ins, professional communication.
* Appoint a leader to coordinate (not dominate).
* Write coherently, accurately, and concisely.
