## ⚠️ Limitations

1. **Data Coverage** - Only 8.5% of records have environmental data
2. **Temporal Bias** - Historical data may not capture recent changes
3. **Feature Engineering** - Relies on derived traffic features
4. **Causality** - Predicts but doesn't explain causation
5. **Class Balance** - Perfectly balanced due to percentile splitting

---

## 🔬 Future Work

1. Expand environmental data collection (mobile sensors)
2. Develop causal models for intervention planning
3. Integrate real-time incident data
4. Create region-specific models
5. Assess climate change impacts

## 📞 Quick Answers

**Q: Why XGBoost over Neural Networks?**  
A: 0.4% better accuracy, 10× faster training, much more interpretable, handles missing data natively.

**Q: Why do environmental features contribute so little?**  
A: Traffic causes pollution, not vice versa. Correlation ≠ causation.

**Q: Can this model be deployed now?**  
A: Yes! 98.30% accuracy with ±0.04% stability indicates production readiness.

**Q: What's the most important feature?**  
A: Peak hour traffic (61.4% importance), followed by evening rush (22.2%).

**Q: How much do location features help?**  
A: 7.6-13.6% contribution, validating the hybrid approach.

**Q: What's the baseline accuracy?**  
A: 25% (majority class prediction). All models beat this significantly.

**Q: How stable is the model?**  
A: Very stable. Cross-validation std is only ±0.04%, indicating excellent generalization.

**Q: What's the training time?**  
A: ~5-10 minutes for XGBoost on 327k samples with 31 features.
