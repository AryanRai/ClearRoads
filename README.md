## 🎯 Project Overview

ClearRoads is a machine learning system that predicts traffic congestion levels in NSW with **98.30% accuracy** using XGBoost. The system integrates:
- **Traffic patterns** (historical hourly data)
- **Location features** (regional grouping, distance to CBD, urban classification)
- **Environmental data** (air quality and weather)
- **Temporal features** (time, season, holidays)

### 🏆 Key Achievement

**98.30% accuracy** predicting 4-level traffic congestion (Very Low, Low, High, Very High), representing a **73.30 percentage point improvement** over the 25% baseline (3.93× better performance).

### 💡 Key Innovation

**Hybrid Location Features (Strategy 3):**
1. **Regional Grouping** - 6 NSW regions (Sydney, Hunter, Southern, Western, Northern, South West)
2. **Distance to CBD** - Continuous feature capturing urban-rural gradient
3. **Urban Classification** - 4 categories (Urban, Suburban, Regional_City, Regional)

This approach contributes **7.6-13.6%** to predictions while maintaining interpretability.

## 🔬 Methodology

### Target Variable

**4-Class Congestion Classification** (based on daily traffic volume percentiles):

| Class | Range | Threshold | Samples |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Very Low | < 25th percentile | < 1,334 vehicles | 81,779 (25%) |
| Low | 25th-50th percentile | 1,334-8,473 vehicles | 81,781 (25%) |
| High | 50th-75th percentile | 8,473-21,639 vehicles | 81,782 (25%) |
| Very High | ≥ 75th percentile | ≥ 21,639 vehicles | 81,785 (25%) |

**Baseline:** 25% (always predict most common class)

### Machine Learning Pipeline

```python
Pipeline([
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('classifier', Model())
])
```

**Models Evaluated:**
1. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k=5)** - Distance-based classification
2. **Decision Tree (max_depth=10)** - Interpretable rule-based model
3. **Random Forest (n_estimators=100)** - Ensemble of decision trees
4. **Neural Network (100-50 layers)** - Deep learning approach
5. **XGBoost (n_estimators=100)** - Gradient boosting ⭐ BEST

### Evaluation Strategy

- **Cross-Validation:** 5-fold Stratified (maintains class balance)
- **Train-Test Split:** 80/20 (stratified by congestion class)
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
- **Feature Importance:** SHAP values and built-in importance scores

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Filtering:** Keep only records with environmental data (8.5%)
2. **Imputation:** Suburb-specific medians for missing values
3. **Outlier Removal:** Remove < 1st percentile and > 99th percentile
4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Traffic: morning_rush, evening_rush, peak_hour_traffic
   - Air Quality: AQI_composite (weighted index)
   - Location: urban_type classification
   - Temporal: is_weekend, season
5. **Encoding:** One-hot encoding for categorical features

## 🎯 Key Findings

### 1. Traffic Patterns Dominate (85.8%)
Historical traffic data is the strongest predictor. Peak hour traffic alone contributes 61.4% to predictions.

**Implication:** Traffic monitoring infrastructure is critical for accurate predictions.

### 2. Location Features Matter (7.6-13.6%)
Geographic context significantly improves accuracy and interpretability:
- Distance to CBD captures urban-rural gradient
- Regional grouping captures large-scale patterns
- Urban classification captures density effects

**Implication:** Location-aware models generalize better to new areas.

### 3. Environment is Effect, Not Cause (1.7%)
Air quality and weather contribute minimally to predictions, confirming that **traffic causes pollution**, not vice versa.

**Implication:** Traffic reduction strategies should focus on traffic management, not pollution reduction.

### 4. XGBoost Provides Optimal Balance
- Highest accuracy (98.30%)
- Excellent stability (±0.04%)
- Good interpretability (feature importance)
- Efficient training and prediction
- Handles missing data natively

**Implication:** XGBoost is production-ready for deployment.
